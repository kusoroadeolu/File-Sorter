0. Create a folder to store these versions(I need a way to store versions based on maybe datetime or some other method )
1. Retrieve the event context and event kind from the directory watcher
2. Anytime the event context is modify create a new file with a new timestamp
3. If the file is created then create a new file with timestamp 0 123

Keep track of the old file and compare the content of the old file to the modified file. If the file content is still the same not modified else modified
